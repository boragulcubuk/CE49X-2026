   "source": "## Background\n\nA fuel distribution company is planning to open **3 new gas stations** in Istanbul. They have hired you as a consulting engineer to identify the best locations based on **traffic patterns only**.\n\nWe provide a starter traffic dataset covering one week of hourly sensor readings across Istanbul (`istanbul_traffic_week.csv` + `sensor_coords.csv`). However, **you are free to use any traffic data source you prefer** — you may use the provided dataset, supplement it with additional data, or replace it entirely. Some options:\n\n- **Provided dataset:** `istanbul_traffic_week.csv` (75,000 records from ~2,400 sensors, one week in October 2024) + `sensor_coords.csv` (sensor coordinates)\n- **IBB Open Data Portal:** Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality publishes live and historical traffic data at [data.ibb.gov.tr](https://data.ibb.gov.tr). You can query their APIs for broader coverage or more recent data.\n- **Other sources:** Any publicly available traffic dataset for Istanbul is acceptable (e.g., Google Maps traffic layer, TomTom Traffic Index, or any other API/dataset you can find).\n\n**Whatever data you use, clearly document your source and how you obtained it.**\n\nYour job is to:\n1. **Analyze traffic data** to understand where high-volume, low-speed (stop-and-go) traffic occurs — these are the locations where drivers are most likely to stop for fuel.\n2. **Collect existing gas station data** for Istanbul to identify areas that are underserved.\n3. **Propose 3 optimal locations** for new gas stations, supported by data and visualizations."

   "source": "## Deliverables\n\nYour notebook must include the following:\n\n### 1. Traffic Data — Source & Exploration\n- **Document your traffic data source.** If you use the provided dataset, state that. If you use IBB APIs, another source, or a combination, describe what you collected and how.\n- Load and explore your traffic data\n- Compute per-location summary statistics: **mean daily vehicle count**, **mean speed**, **peak-hour vehicle count** (adapt as needed to your data)\n- Identify temporal patterns: how does traffic volume vary by **hour of day** and **day of week**?\n- Identify the **top 20 highest-traffic locations** by total vehicle count\n\n### 2. Traffic-Based Demand Scoring\n- Design a **demand score** for each location that captures how attractive it is for a gas station. Your score should consider at least:\n  - **High vehicle volume** (more cars = more potential customers)\n  - **Low average speed** (slow/congested traffic = drivers more willing to stop)\n  - **Consistency** across hours and days (a location busy only at 3 AM is less useful)\n- Clearly explain and justify the formula or method you use\n- Rank all locations by your demand score\n\n### 3. Existing Gas Station Data (you must collect this)\n- Collect the locations of **existing gas stations across Istanbul**\n- You must have **at least 200 stations** with latitude/longitude coordinates\n- **Document your data source and collection method** in a markdown cell\n- For each of your high-demand locations, compute the **distance to the nearest existing gas station**\n\n### 4. Site Selection\n- Combine your demand score with existing station proximity to identify **underserved, high-demand areas**\n- A great location has: high demand score AND is far from existing gas stations\n- Propose **exactly 3 locations** for new gas stations\n- For each proposed location, report:\n  - Coordinates (latitude, longitude)\n  - The neighborhood/district name\n  - Your demand score\n  - Distance to the nearest existing gas station\n  - A brief justification (2-3 sentences)\n\n### 5. Visualizations\n- Create **at least three plots/maps**. Suggested visualizations (or propose your own):\n  - A heatmap or scatter map of demand scores across Istanbul\n  - A map showing existing gas stations and your 3 proposed locations\n  - A bar chart or time-series plot showing traffic patterns at your proposed locations\n- All plots must be publication-quality: labeled axes, title, legend, grid where appropriate\n- Interactive maps (e.g., folium) are encouraged but not required\n\n### 6. Discussion\n- Write a short discussion (2-3 paragraphs) addressing:\n  - Why did you choose these 3 locations over other candidates?\n  - What **limitations** does a traffic-only analysis have? What other factors would a real site selection study consider (e.g., land cost, zoning, competition, road type)?\n  - If you had access to one additional dataset, what would it be and how would it improve your analysis?"
